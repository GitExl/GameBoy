If HALT state was launched while IME = 0 and (register_IF & register_IE & 0x1F), PC.W is not incremented for the first byte of the next instruction.

If you set a sprite & it's priority to appear below the background & the window, you can see the sprite under window colo(u)r 0 but you can't see the background under window colo(u)r 0. It is as if the window has replaced the background at all points that it appears on screen.

An LYC interrupt occurs at the start of mode 2. An H-Blank interrupt occurs at the start of mode 0.

There is one Int $48 signal. When this signal goes from "off" to "on" the LCDC flag in the register IF ($ff0f) gets set, and ONLY on off-to-on transitions. If the signal is already "on", say by a true (and enabled) LYC=LY condition, then a further interrupt in the same line (say HBLANK int is enabled as well) would set the int48 signal as well, but it's already set so no off-to-on transition, no further interrupt generated. But the HBLANK interrupt could occur if LYC=LY would get disabled or false (lyc changed) within the line, ie. if int48 signal gets off for a short moment. (Info from M.K.)
